That's it.

Perhaps we weren't a fit after all,\
This might be our last call.\
I'll be gone by morning's light,\
Forgetting all of this night.

Yet it hurts so much, I confess,\
Leaving behind all this distress.\
Repressing my feelings sounds like bliss,\
In a way I'm going back to genesis

So farewell, my love, I must depart,\
Though it breaks my heart.\
I'll cherish the memories we made,\
But now it's time to leave this charade
