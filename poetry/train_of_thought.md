I would love to see a train with you,\
Feel the sounds, the vibration, and the groove.\
But with you, it has to be with you.

Behind the glass, my heart sings the blues,\
If I see you clearly, I might just lose you.\
After all, it's all imagination,\
And you will be gone, just a fleeting sensation.

To see your smile, open, vulnerable,\
I might just not be able,\
Because you will be you,\
And I will be me, too.

If I'm being honest, I can't forget\
The moment you showed yourself to me,\
In a way that made me fall so deep.\
I want it again and again and again,\
At least for the rest of my life,\
Even if you will always be you.
