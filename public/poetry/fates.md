My heart whispers warnings,\
But I turn a deaf ear.\
Until the pain erupts,\
Like a volcano's tear.

I defy the inner voice\
That tells me to stay away.\
And now my heart's ablaze,\
From the embers of yesterday.

Fate's cruel hand\
Has placed me with someone\
Who defies its decree.\
But I can't break free.
