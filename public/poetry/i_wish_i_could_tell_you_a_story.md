I wish I could tell you a story.\
A tale of two friends, so merry.\
One friend, with a heart so kind.\
A gentle soul, you'd surely find.\
The other, with a spirit bright.\
A beacon in the darkest night.

But alas, this friendship is just a dream.\
A figment of my mind's eye.\
For you are but a stranger.\
And I am just a passerby.

I wish I could tell you a story.\
Of a friendship that never could be.
